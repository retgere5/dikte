## Running the tests

```sh
python -m unittest discover          # all of them, about a second
python -m unittest tests.test_api    # one file
python -m unittest tests.test_api.Transcribe.test_no_key_at_all
```

Nothing to install: the tests use the standard library's `unittest`, and the
only dependency is the PyQt6 the application already needs. They reach neither
the network, the microphone, nor your real `~/.config/dikte`, so they are safe
to run anywhere and they run on a machine with no display.

CI runs the same command on Python 3.11 through 3.13. A pull request that turns
it red will not be merged.

## Writing one

Put it in `tests/`, named after the module it covers. Inherit from
`tests.support.DikteTest` whenever the code under test touches a file, a
setting or the interface language: it hands the test its own config and data
directories, resets the language, and puts them back afterwards.

`tests/support.py` has the rest of what you need:

| For | Use |
| --- | --- |
| An HTTP call | `fake_urlopen(reply, …)`, then read the recorded requests |
| A reply that fails | `http_error(429)`, `url_error()`, `raw_body("not json")` |
| Reading what was sent | `sent_json(request)`, `multipart_fields(request)` |
| A program on the PATH | `only_these_tools("pactl", "wl-copy")` |
| Standing on another system | `mock.patch.object(sys, "platform", "darwin")` |
| Audio | `silence()`, `tone()`, `speech()`, `stereo()`, `make_wav()` |
| A settings object | `self.config(cleanup_enabled=False)` |

Three things about this codebase trip up a new test:

**Signals from a worker thread are never delivered.** `Pipeline`, `MeetingPipeline`
and `FileTranscriber` emit from the thread `start()` spawned, which Qt queues
until an event loop runs one. Call `_work()` directly instead: it is the same
code one frame down, and the signals arrive at once.

**A level that never moves is not speech.** The silence check is relative, so a
steady tone reads as its own noise floor however loud it is. Use `speech()`
rather than `tone()` when a recording is meant to have somebody talking in it.

**`cli.launch_gui` replaces the process.** With no instance running, some verbs
`os.execv` into the application, which would take the test run with it. Patch
`cli.launch_gui`. `DikteTest` blocks `os.execv` as a backstop, so a test that
forgets fails rather than hangs.

## Another platform

Four systems are supported: Wayland, X11, macOS and Windows. Each one is a
named entry in a table, and one chooser picks between them, so a fifth adds an
entry and a line rather than a branch inside every function. The three tables
are `paste.Desktop` (clipboard and key press; a system with no clipboard
program to shell out to fills `read_call`/`copy_call` instead of
`read_command`/`copy_command`), `audio.Sound` (capture and the device lists)
and the `_macos()`/`_gnome()`/`_windows()` trio in `hotkey.py`. Keep
`sys.platform` inside the chooser and read it there every time: a constant
settled at import is one no test can stand somewhere else.

The tests are split along the same line, and almost none of them are skipped.
1070 of the 1115 run on any machine, including every line of the Wayland, X11,
macOS and Windows backends: the programs are faked at `shutil.which`, the
frameworks at the one function that loads them, and Windows's user32 calls at
the ctypes seam `paste.py` and `hotkey.py` each load them through. A test class
says which system it is standing on rather than avoiding the question:

```python
class MacOS(ClipboardContract, DikteTest):
    platform = "darwin"
    here = paste.MACOS
```

so the Linux half is checked on a Mac and the macOS half on Linux, and a change
to a chooser cannot quietly break the platform nobody is sitting at. What the
systems owe in common is written once as a contract class and subclassed by each
of them.

The 43 that do carry `@linux_only` are the ones that would need the real thing:
the `/dev/input` listener, KDE's shortcut file, GNOME's gsettings. Mark a test
that way only when faking it would leave nothing to test. A test that quietly
stops running on the platform you are porting to protects nothing.

## What a pull request should carry

A change to behaviour comes with a test for it. Adding a provider means a row in
`config.TRANSCRIBERS` and a test that the request goes to the right URL with the
right fields; adding a platform means a test for whatever the parsing of its
device list, clipboard or shortcuts looks like. Adding a setting means both halves of `settings_ui.py`: the round
trip in `tests/test_ui.py` is what catches only one of them being written.

Match the surrounding code: it is plain Python with no framework, comments
explain why rather than what, and neither the code nor the commit messages use
an em dash.
